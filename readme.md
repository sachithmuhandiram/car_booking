# Car Booking website

Here I am trying to implement a simple car booking site. I will develop this site as I learn golang and web development. If you see any error or mistake I have made, please update me.

I wont be developing front-end pages, I will get them from other github packages.

I will try to follow [golang-standards](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout) for development.
